## Completed Project Page: [Belly Button Biodiversity](https://alexmartinez1745.github.io/Plotly-Challenge/)

Tools used: Plotly, Bootstrap (V3.3), D3 library 

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset provided in the data folder, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Steps Taken: Plotly

1. Used the D3 library to read in the data. Used the console frequently to check if data was read in correctly.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Display the individual's demographic information.

5. Add a Gauge Chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual selected from the dropdown options.

6. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
